# Advent of Code

### https://adventofcode.com/

- Python solutions, because Python.
- Since this is for fun, I'm _not_ going for:
  - Completion Speed
  - Execution Speed
  - Minimalistic Code
- I just wanted to solve the puzzles.


### Examples
##### Run with sample data, usually given in the problem or slightly modified
```python3
python 2018/aoc.py -s 6
```

##### Run with my input data (may be long running)
```python3
python 2018/aoc.py 6
```

##### Run multiple days
```python3
python 2018/aoc.py 3 4 6
```
